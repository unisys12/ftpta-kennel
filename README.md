FTPTA KENNEL
============

This project is for use by my wife and I to help run our dog training business. It is in no way meant to be used to manage an actual kennel. _"So why the heck did you use Kennel in the name?"_
Because I couldn't think of anything better at the time. There!

## Usage
Not really ready to document at this time.

## To Do's
- Add Youtube support
- ~~Update project to support PHP 8.1~~
- ~~Update NPM dependencies~~
- Solve issue with editing users and canine profiles _(outlined below)_

## Current Issues
_I know there's a whole section of the repo designed for this..._

### Profile Image Updates
- When making an edit to a Canine or User/Client profile image, the updated S3 url for the image is not being updated in the DB. On creation, it works fine.
